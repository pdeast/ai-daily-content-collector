## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Clone and Install

```bash
# Navigate to the project directory
cd ai-eba

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Configure Environment Variables

Copy the example environment file and configure it:

```bash
cp env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` with your actual values:

```bash
# AI Provider (claude, openai, or gemini)
AI_PROVIDER=claude

# Claude API Key (get from https://console.anthropic.com/)
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-your-key-here

# Email Configuration (Gmail example)
EMAIL_FROM=your.email@gmail.com
EMAIL_TO=your.email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASSWORD=your-app-password-here
SMTP_SERVER=smtp.gmail.com
SMTP_PORT=587

# Schedule Time (24-hour format)
SCHEDULE_TIME=06:00
```

#### 📧 Gmail Setup (Recommended)

To use Gmail, you need to create an **App Password**:

1. Go to your Google Account settings
2. Enable 2-Factor Authentication if not already enabled
3. Go to [App Passwords](https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords)
4. Select "Mail" and your device
5. Copy the generated 16-character password
6. Use this password in `EMAIL_PASSWORD` (not your regular Gmail password)

### 3. Customize Your Topics (Optional)

The system comes pre-configured with comprehensive topics for tech professionals. You can edit `config.yaml` to customize:

```yaml
assistant_name: "Your AI Assistant"  # Name your assistant!
user_name: "Your Name"

topics:
  - name: "AI Technologies & Research"
    category: "AI/ML"
    sources:
      - type: "rss"
        url: "https://blog.openai.com/rss/"
      - type: "rss"
        url: "https://www.anthropic.com/news/rss.xml"
  
  - name: "Cybersecurity News"
    category: "Security"
    sources:
      - type: "rss"
        url: "https://krebsonsecurity.com/feed/"
  
  # 10+ more pre-configured topics included!
```

### 4. Test Your Setup

```bash
# Test the full brief generation
python test_brief.py

# Test the new AI recommendations feature
python test_recommendations.py
```

This will generate and send a test email immediately. Check your inbox!

### 5. Start the Scheduler

```bash
# Start the scheduler
./start_scheduler.sh

# Check status
./status_scheduler.sh

# Stop when needed
./stop_scheduler.sh
```

The scheduler will run in the background and send your brief at the configured time every day.

## 📋 Configuration Options

### Summarization Settings

```yaml
summarization:
  model: "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022"  # Claude model for best results
  max_articles_per_topic: 5  # Limit articles per topic
  summary_length: "brief"  # brief, medium, or detailed
```

### Email Settings

```yaml
email:
  subject: "Your Morning Brief - {date}"
  include_links: true
  group_by_category: true
```

## 🔧 Advanced Usage

### Finding RSS Feeds

Most blogs and news sites have RSS feeds. Common locations:
- `/feed/`
- `/rss/`
- `/feed.xml`
- `/rss.xml`

Use browser extensions like "RSS Feed Reader" to find feeds on any site.

### Alternative Email Providers

The system works with any SMTP server. Common providers:

**Outlook/Hotmail:**
```
SMTP_SERVER=smtp-mail.outlook.com
SMTP_PORT=587
```

**Yahoo:**
```
SMTP_SERVER=smtp.mail.yahoo.com
SMTP_PORT=587
```

### Running as a Background Service

#### macOS (launchd):

Create `~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.user.ai-assistant.plist`:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
    <key>Label</key>
    <string>com.user.ai-assistant</string>
    <key>ProgramArguments</key>
    <array>
        <string>/usr/local/bin/python3</string>
        <string>/Users/markmishaev/ai-eba/scheduler.py</string>
    </array>
    <key>WorkingDirectory</key>
    <string>/Users/markmishaev/ai-eba</string>
    <key>RunAtLoad</key>
    <true/>
    <key>KeepAlive</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
</plist>
```

Load the service:
```bash
launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.user.ai-assistant.plist
```

#### Linux (systemd):

Create `/etc/systemd/system/ai-assistant.service`:

```ini
[Unit]
Description=Personal AI Assistant
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
User=yourusername
WorkingDirectory=/home/yourusername/ai-eba
ExecStart=/usr/bin/python3 /home/yourusername/ai-eba/scheduler.py
Restart=always

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Enable and start:
```bash
sudo systemctl enable ai-assistant
sudo systemctl start ai-assistant
```

### Docker Deployment

The included `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` run the scheduler in a container. `config.yaml` and `.env` are not baked into the image — `docker-compose.yml` bind-mounts `config.yaml` read-only and loads `.env` via `env_file`, so editing either on the host takes effect on the container's next scheduled run without a rebuild.

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

#### Production deployment (jazz)

In production this runs as the `ai-daily-content-collector` service in the `~/src/docker` infra repo's `jazz/docker-compose.yml`, deployed remotely via `docker context use jazz` (see that repo's `CLAUDE.md` for the full setup). Two things to know if you're changing `config.yaml` or the app code:

- **Build context**: `jazz/docker-compose.yml` builds with `context: ../../ai-daily-content-collector`, i.e. this repo checked out locally at `~/src/ai-daily-content-collector`. Because deploys run via `docker context use jazz` from that local checkout, code changes just need a local commit/checkout — `docker compose up -d --build` sends the local build context to the remote daemon.
- **`config.yaml` bind mount**: unlike the build context, bind mount sources are resolved on jazz's own filesystem, not sent from the local client. `~/src/ai-daily-content-collector/config.yaml` on jazz is a standalone file (not a git checkout) and does **not** sync automatically from this repo or from your local machine. After editing `config.yaml` locally, copy it to jazz by hand:
  ```bash
  scp ~/src/ai-daily-content-collector/config.yaml jazz.eastfamily.io:~/src/ai-daily-content-collector/config.yaml
  ```
  No rebuild or restart is needed afterward — the container reads the file fresh on each scheduled run.

## 🎨 Customizing the Email Template

Edit `src/email_sender.py` to modify the HTML template. The template uses Jinja2, making it easy to customize:

- Change colors and styles in the `<style>` section
- Modify the layout in the HTML body
- Add your own branding or logos

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### No articles in the brief
- Check if the RSS feeds are valid (test them in a feed reader)
- Adjust `hours_back` parameter in the ContentAggregator
- Some feeds may not publish daily content

### Email not sending
- Verify your SMTP credentials
- For Gmail, ensure you're using an App Password, not your regular password
- Check that 2FA is enabled on your Google account
- Look for error messages in the logs

### API errors
- Verify your OpenAI API key is correct
- Check your API quota/billing
- Ensure you have internet connectivity

### Rate limiting
- The system processes articles sequentially to avoid rate limits
- If you have many articles, consider increasing delays or reducing `max_articles_per_topic`

## 💡 Tips for Best Results

1. **Start small**: Begin with 2-3 topics and gradually add more
2. **Quality over quantity**: Focus on high-quality RSS feeds
3. **Test regularly**: Use `test_brief.py` when adding new sources
4. **Adjust summary length**: Experiment with "brief", "medium", or "detailed"
5. **Schedule wisely**: Choose a time when you typically check email

## 🔒 Security Notes

- Never commit your `.env` file to version control
- Keep your API keys secure
- Use app-specific passwords for email services
- Regularly rotate your API keys

## 📊 Cost Estimation

Using GPT-4o-mini (recommended):
- ~10 articles/day × 30 days = $0.50-1.00/month
- OpenAI API is pay-as-you-go

Using GPT-4:
- ~10 articles/day × 30 days = $3-5/month

RSS feeds and email are completely free!

## 🚧 Future Enhancements
